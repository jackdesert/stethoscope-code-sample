Q: What does Stethoscope do?
A: It receives badge rssi data through its /rssi_readings API,
   and eventually it will predict where a badge is located.

Q: Why is this written in Python, when much of our other software is in Ruby?
A: Python is a strong choice for data analysis, and has solid libraries
   for deep learning, which Jack hopes to use in determining location.
   Also, Jack has had renewed interest in learning Python really well.

Q: Why (as of July 2018) is the database sqlite?
A: It's fast enough, it's the simplest SQL system to set up, and it is also
   convenient for copying datasets.

   Regarding speed of sqlite,  in July 2018 Jack conducted load tests against
   stethoscope, and assuming 5% uniqueness, stethoscope can handle 400 requests
   per second (of which only 20/second are database writes because of 5%
   uniqueness assumption) which represents 4 pis per house, 20 badges per
   house, and five total houses.  The load test was conducted with sqlite in
   place, and the database was not the bottleneck. The bottleneck was that the
   server ran out of file descriptors.
