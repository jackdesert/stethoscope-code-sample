    # Otherwise when you get a 502 in the browser, it will get
    # Content-Type:application/octet-stream
    # and your browser may not know how to display it
    #
    # Option 1: Set default_type to text/html and call your service with .json
    #           ending if you want 502 responses to be application/json
    #           Unfortunately, this means your service is available
    #           both with and without the .json, and you only get the
    #           desired outcome with the latter.
    # Option 2: Set default_type to application/json and accept the fact
    #           that 502 in the browser will be less than beautiful
